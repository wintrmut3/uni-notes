\begin{itemize}
    \item First year ~ Most midterms
    \item Calc II is harder - word problems
    \item Calc III is easier than calc II
    \item Dynamics is more physics, less math
    \item Circuits ~ ECE110 is retaught in second year, lots of memorization
    \item APS112 - The lecture content is similar to APS111
    \item Second year ECE101 is more useful
    \item Second year has a lot of labs - prelabs/postlabs, tries to teach all 6 specializations at once.
    \item Calc III is more applicatory for ECE, physics
    \item Digital Systems - Programming chips, low level (Hard labs)
    \item Programming fundamentals - C++ version of APS105 (Object oriented), labs are okay, exams can be interesting
    \item ECE201 teaches the six areas of ECE
    \item Circuit analysis should be easier
    \item ECE243 Computer organization - Machine code/assembly
    \item ECE297 Comms \& Design - Biggest time sink (easy to do okay, diminishing returns for 90+)
    \item ECE231 - Intro electronics, all of analog electronics in one course, very content heavy, difficulty spikes @ final/midterm
    \item ECE Signals and systems - Adv. engineering math (Applied Calc III)
    \item Y3 - More interest based, less generic, PEY in S1 (use algorithms \& data structures)
    \item Operating systems is pretty hard
    \subsection{PEY}
    \item A lot different from school
    \item Look on PEY portal/outside, May have several interviews
    \item Two rounds of released jobs - 1st and 2nd semester beginning
    \item The ECE background is very wide - optics/software/electronics/hardware/EM, grades aren't that important\\\\
    \item Fourth year is a change of pace
    \item You should try to take a shorter fourth year
    \item Full time job search is harder
